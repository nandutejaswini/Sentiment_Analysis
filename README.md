# Sentiment Analysis Using LSTM

This project demonstrates the application of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews. It uses Keras and TensorFlow to create and train an LSTM model to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral based on their content.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Converts raw text into a format suitable for the LSTM model.
- **Model Training**: Trains an LSTM model on preprocessed text data.
- **Sentiment Prediction**: Uses the trained model to predict the sentiment of new movie reviews.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses the accuracy and effectiveness of the model on a test dataset.
